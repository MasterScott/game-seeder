		<description><![CDATA[FYI: Fitgirl did not include the Support folders so the Codex updates for 1.1 1.2 and 1.3 that did not use Denuvo CAN NOT be used.

Support\ReadMe\de-DE\ReadMe.txt File not found!
Support\ReadMe\en-US\ReadMe.txt File not found!
Support\ReadMe\es-ES\ReadMe.txt File not found!
Support\ReadMe\fr-FR\ReadMe.txt File not found!
Support\ReadMe\pl-PL\ReadMe.txt File not found!
Support\ReadMe\ru-RU\ReadMe.txt File not found!

That&#039;s the error you&#039;ll get.

You need to find someone with those support files or use a regular CODEX non repack.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To everyone coming here asking does this contain all the DLC.  This version is before Ubisoft added Denuvo copy protection to the game, and therefore only has what it was originally released like on steam and the Ubisoft site.

Claims that Denuvo has been cracked in 2205 are not true.  There are no release editions with all the DLC.  There are unlikely to be any complete editions of this game in the near future either.

This game is near the end of it&#039;s shelf life.  The current edition is called  2205 ultimate edition and it contains all of the dlc.  It is currently not sale,  but the spring 2017 steam sale is due in about 5 or 6 week&#039;s time and I wouldn&#039;t be remotely surprised to see this game on sale at 70%.  When I bought 2070 complete edition, when it first went on sale in the steam spring sale, I got it at 70% off.  Ubisoft are nothing if predictable, so if the DLC matters to you, then its really better to wait for the steam spring sale and buy it for almost nothing, because otherwise your going to be waiting for a very long time for the ultimate denuvo version to be cracked with all DLC]]></description>
