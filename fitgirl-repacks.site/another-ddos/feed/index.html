		<description><![CDATA[Well, you can certainly repack a thing you own for archival purpose, yes - but that is not our case here, Johnathan.  Possession/storage, use, receipt, transmittal of pirated/hacked/cracked materials (copyright infringement) is seldom smiled on anywhere.

That is what this is, that is why we are any of us here (except for those who truly are only here to sniffing Snezhana bicycle seat).

		<description><![CDATA[And to what end, my enthusiastic friend, to what end? Better to identify and end them legally, with restraint and caution in controlled manner - DDoS it makes messes everywhere, it is bad thing even if you are not directly targeted. If you are truly her flag, a banner of righteous tight packaging, you should  organize support and we send her warm clothes, toiletries, FOOD and little knickknack from over the world. She is stationed in Latvia and while that is by no means bad duty from many standpoints, it also is not Bahamas and every bit can helping. Send her some bitcoin for a Latte and don&#039;t launch some &#039;strikes&#039;  - these days you cannot always know who&#039;s pool you pissing in and is anyways wrong to do &#039;bad things&#039; in response to bad things - and, even if you are bullheaded, do not announce intentions, especially of troublemaking, because you can get credit, sure, even if you don&#039;t do nothing!! How is that good?! &quot;Hey, I&#039;m going to kick some bees ass!&quot; and they here you and now they are sting you!! and you only just made noise and no kicking of any ass! &quot;Ouch! Oh Shit - I DON&#039;T DID NOTHING!!&quot; - but they don&#039;t care and you not honeybadger enough to take it, so... yeah... send her some warm clothes and such things.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ehyah...
Do not make tears... go to this place: http://fitgirl-repacks.site/faq/ and read. Then, find a nice copy of FreeArc. With FreeArc in hand, and with the wonderful information present at the places listed in the FAQ, make a studied attempt to repack Wildlands. Do your very best, and then present your results to not only the world, but to Snezhana saying &quot;O FitGirl, I have found within me the strength to attempt a new thing, a good thing, just as you have done so many tiumes for us! The path was long, rocky, and winding - but, with your shining example and the love in my heart for you - I PERSEVERED! Lo! TahDah!&quot; and then, you know, post some link to your achievement. We will be impressed, Snezhana will be impressed and her workload lightened by your kind and devoted efforts - you will be hero.

Forty years ago it was cold war. Meh. Snezhana and I could not have shared anything without much trouble - actual bullets and kicking down of doors and much much tension - it was that way if one was east and other was west. This side, that side, us, them, blahblahblah.... I can confirm for you this: We all &#039;folks&#039;. We all make bathroom, we eat, we sleep, we love. Always, always remember that - that vast majority of us is just &#039;folks&#039;. When you find anger for any attacker of you in life - see them only for the bad things they themself do and not their nationality, color, language, clothes, religion, their &#039;scene&#039; - is all only just eye candy. 
An evil person can  stand in a group of &#039;just folks&#039; and if we are not careful, that one evil person taints those &#039;folks&#039; and then some calls for jihads/pogroms/crusades - whatever is can be called -go out where, ah, now, us &#039;just folks&#039; are become &#039;just assholes&#039; to attack/harass/macerate those other &#039;just folks&#039; who we have perceived to be &#039;just assholes&#039; because of just one PoS standing near them.  I mention this because it goes that way so many times in the world and I don&#039;t like that and no one of us should. 
You should like variety in the world, you should like as much as you can, if only to get to eat some very fine foodstuffs you otherwise don&#039;t, or play some game or read something you otherwise don&#039;t, or to meet wonderful persons like Snezhana who is very adept at packing things tightly and sharing them with us (even at my age), nie?]]></description>
