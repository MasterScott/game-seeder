		<description><![CDATA[Hey Fitgirl, Great repack! I&#039;m just a wondering. I&#039;ve had this bug where on the first couple of missions where you talk to ivy, the sound just completely turns off. Its gone for about 3-5 seconds and it comes back. I&#039;ve had no significant crashes whatsoever. Game runs absolutely amazing on my system. Have tried restarting the mission to validate it and 4 out of 4 times it happened. Maybe someone can help? Thanks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I agree with Flash Gamers. Kamico o I have only encountered one issue with her repacks after downloading atleast 30. One of the Hyperdimension neptunia&#039;s i believe it was. Problem with a soundfile that one user posted the fix for. Your pc clearly can&#039;t handle new games and if you have to critcize people&#039;s work because your computer fails maybe you should give up gaming and go play with barbie dolls. To Fitgirl, great job with the games. I wish i had found your site sooner as there are other games i want just no seeders and with all the attacks made against site&#039;s as of late hard to find a good legit person still doing things like this.]]></description>
