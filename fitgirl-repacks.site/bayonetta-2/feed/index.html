To update cemu : 1) download it 2) uncompress it on ./cemu directory of bayonetta2 fitgirl repack [replace old files with new cemu files]
All the savegames are on ./cemu/mlc01/emulatorSave, so save them often, we never know.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[PLEASE DON&#039;T DETECT THIS AS A SPAM, SYSTEM.

1. First of all, about &lt;strong&gt;Cemu&lt;/strong&gt;, the software is &lt;strong&gt;better&lt;/strong&gt; than other emulators. If your PC is better than mine then I hope you can enjoy Bayonetta 2 flawlessly, but if it&#039;s equal or under powered then mine, then you can try but it&#039;s better to &lt;strong&gt;wait&lt;/strong&gt; for many more &lt;strong&gt;updates&lt;/strong&gt; to enjoy it flawlessly.

&lt;strong&gt;MY PC SPECS&lt;/strong&gt; -
AMD Phenom II X4 960T
DDR2 4GB RAM
GTX 750Ti 2GB

&lt;strong&gt;My experience&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;em&gt;Smooth gameplay with regular freezes:stutters(ratio 7:1). Also game worked a little bit better in video with the version provided by Fitgirl than the latest one, so might wanna stick with that, cause I don&#039;t know that much about this software.&lt;/em&gt; But it &lt;strong&gt;doesn&#039;t have as many options&lt;/strong&gt; as other emulators like pcsx2. I tried different settings, but if you encounter the ongoing loop sound, the bad about that is you can&#039;t hear what is going on, just that loop sound. You have to close and start it again to get rid of it.

Other than that some physical &#038; virtual &lt;strong&gt;ram advice&lt;/strong&gt;, if you have lesser ram than 4GB then keep using your current/default/2x settings. But if you have 4GB RAM or more I would recommend keeping the virtual ram to 1024MB, which is acceptable by the application and you won&#039;t receive any error messages from windows. I hope that will result in better performance especially if you have 8GB or 16GB RAM.


2. Now about, &lt;strong&gt;Bayonetta 2&lt;/strong&gt;, I played the game without audio so it saved the game from those loop sounds I couldn&#039;t bear to hear.

&lt;strong&gt;Over-rated game&lt;/strong&gt; because of over-sexual fashionably dressed &#038; haired  beautiful girls, I HOPE I GOT THAT RIGHT.

(This part I played with audio before)

&lt;em&gt;The game starts, a person starts speaking I don&#039;t know shit about. Action starts then.....&lt;/em&gt;

(Skip some part without audio, then I played with audio)

&lt;em&gt;Onto the next level, story starts, bla bla bla, again don&#039;t know WTF is going on, then action starts, and after sometime bayonetta summons a monster to kill another one she and her friend were fighting with, then that monster kicks her friend&#039;s soul out, which means she&#039;s dead for the time I guess, then bayonetta fights with that monster and kills it with summoning another monster&lt;/em&gt; AND I WAS LIKE WHAT!!!!!!

&lt;em&gt;Another story video and talk I don&#039;t have any idea about. Then she lands on an island, a little bit of walk, what a relief, but again action.&lt;/em&gt; I PLAYED UPTO HERE &#038; A BIT MORE.

&lt;strong&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;/strong&gt; - You wouldn&#039;t understand what&#039;s going on, so I would say try Bayonetta-1(I hope it&#039;s better) first, then if you really really want to try this, only then give it a chance, otherwise don&#039;t. Cause likwise it will be a painful experience as it happens with other emulators.

The screen keeps flickering(like a tubelight) at a lot of points especially where there&#039;s water. As for a game launched in 2014, graphics aren&#039;t that good, 60 FPS on menu and 30 FPS on gameplay. I mean come on again with that 30 FPS crap. Stupid lame story not even potrayed like a video but images. I mean that&#039;s me, but it&#039;s your choice that Does it really deserve a chance included that painful gameplay if you don&#039;t have a better PC?]]></description>
