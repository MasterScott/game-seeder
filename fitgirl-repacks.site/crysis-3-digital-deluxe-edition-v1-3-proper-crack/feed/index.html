		<description><![CDATA[Anyone know how to fix the no profile active bug? Game installs fine, launches fine, then won&#039;t retain any settings or save, and crashes after the first main cut scene as the helicopter is about to drop you off with error no active profile.

Funny thing is I had this same repack installed on this same rig and it ran fine. Uninstalled to move it to a different drive and now it does this regardless of which drive I install it to. I suspect issues with Creator&#039;s Update, but I can&#039;t be sure.

I&#039;ve tried running as admin, compatibility mode, deleting all profile/save data so it will recreate, etc.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Downloaded today, and its working perfectly. For anyone having &quot;Crashing Issues&quot; when trying to play on windows 10 like i did, try running the game in Windows 7 Compatibility mode, Also adding the game exe to DEP (search in google Windows DEP If u dont know tfc is dep) Also delete all the shit in your %temp% folder because yes? i did all that shit and i was able to sucefully play the game

Before doing all this stuff i could open the game, but when i tried to play the campaign the game crashed, i tried other fixes like that &quot;map Canyon&quot; shit but it didnt work, after doing all of this when i typed &quot;map Canyon&quot; the campaign started. 

Thanks FitGirl for all the effort you put in the repacks... And a message for all those skids that blame FitGirl for errors with games or complain about the game files. Use the common sense, or learn how to use google like the normal people, and if you dont like the repack buy the fucking game :D. Its ridiculous how the people complains about x or y in most of the repacks FitGirl Uploads like Dark Souls III, or Watch Dogs 2, When the games are working without troubles.

Also sorry for my bad english, i havent properly learn the language yet and i was too lazy to use translate for this stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I apologize; the malware wasn&#039;t in the Reloaded v1.2 patch but in an infected v1.0.0.  So no reason to doubt this v1.3.

BTW - site donor here, and I support about 30 Fitgirl repacks in my high-speed seedbox.  Pack on!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does anyone else suspect a keylogger in this, that steals Steam passwords?

I *know* that&#039;s unlikely since the base crack came from Reloaded and has been out for years.  But I&#039;ve done many Windows re-installs and much testing, and this program seems to be the problem.   Also, the file Crysis3.exe has a &quot;hollow process&quot; code injector.  This might be part of the crack, but I don&#039;t find any other warez games using this technique.  It indicates (but does not prove) an infection.

If you have Steam BE SURE to set two-factor authorization on your login.  Especially if you install this game.]]></description>
