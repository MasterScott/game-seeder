		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, that make more sense now. I only know about Dragon Unpacker, VGMtools and QuickBms, from which only the latest can reinject back, but its also not good enough it seems. 
I am becoming more interested recently to also recode because even repacked games they getting too big and unnecessary. 
CoD Advanced Warfare for example use &quot;soundpack&quot; files that have flac lossless audio streams, I tried to extract them for intention to recode to some 64k aac(aside music simple sounds are difficult to hear lower quality) but couldnt figure out how to extract and reinject them back. Header was simple looking each file seemed like flacs stacked at each other but I still couldnt figure out a tool  or process.
I already read many in rin, fileforum and encode but havent found much info into this resources reinjecting topics only general compression.
Anyway, I am sure I&#039;ll learn it over time, and thanks for all you do!

		<description><![CDATA[Hello FG, may I ask how exactly did you modified a5.cpk?  Was it with quickbms? Which script?

Both &quot;en&quot; and &quot;enj&quot; folders(from that file) contain files with non - empty data. Even more funny, after extracting I could not repack them under ~12gb(both have around 13gb), however packing of resource file itself(a5.cpk) actually does go to ~6.xGB??!! WTF?

So I tried it with original codex version, I was only able to get to that size if I reinjected empty files to &quot;enj&quot; folder but upon test re-extracting &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; files(including in &quot;en&quot;) were bad(containg just&quot;.....&quot;) - even if I only re-imported &quot;enj&quot; folder.  I would really appreciate some insight if its not a secret. Like how did you do it and with what tools etc. Sorry if it bother you I know you dont have much time but this thing puzzle me to no end.

Btw I know you ripped lang. and I only selected eng download, but files in enj folder still look like full random data, so I am lost.
(PS: I was able to rip &#038; repack Homefront 2 to about same size as BB, just for myself, but that was much easier.)
thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dont worry about the saves as it isnt placed within the game directory, even your launcher settings will remain instact, for me it was located in documents/my games. I did a backup just in case though, but it wasnt deleted after I uninstalled. Should be golden after reinstalling with both voice packs, it works as it should :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you.  So far interesting game.  I like the anime art style.   I hope there&#039;s more to it than just blasting bears with a loud speaker the whole game.   Probably not, but the story keeps me engaged.   I can play for more than ten minutes without feeling like like ehhh..moving on.]]></description>
