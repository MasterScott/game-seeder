		<description><![CDATA[Didn&#039;t think anybody would answer, sorry for the delay, and thx.  in FSX and NOT  DGFS  message when i try to start the game:
steam must be running to play this game (Steam initilization failed)

like i said it worked 1 time, but installed some win updates &#038; and next time i tried it got the msg above even reinstalling didn&#039;t fix it,  though I didn&#039;t uninstall first.....but might try that  now...

What is your verdict on why I cannot install ANY SKID OR RELOADED titles  but repacks almost always seem to work, even the same game?, just  thought i should ask someone who has a good chance of understanding..

What happens is I mount image ISO or whatever then click Setup.exe   and nothing ever happens,,,,check inside task manager and program is listed but using a very LOW amount of memory and message  (the program is not responding)   always displays.

Any ideas?

thx for any advice/help with this it&#039;s very appreciated]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[now I see exactly why you chose that user id/name...., anyway there&#039;s an issue with dtfs, it wont accumulate  your flying time which means you can&#039;t pass the licenses,    some kind of protection??       as well after watching some you tubes also noticed this must be a very early version as their is no audio speech for thr US south east flight school, but the UK slight school has no audio issue......will you make an update available

Not sure but i think  Microsofts FSX is connected with this game, I also dloaded that from your site, it ran 1 time but it wont start up again now message &quot;steam needs to be running&quot; but if I run steam nothing changes I tried fully reinstalling it nothing happens, do you think I should FULLY uninstall current instance and completely re-install it  (i had to install some OS (win 7 x64) updates and i am thinking maybe the problem is there somewhere??

Thx so much for what you do fitgirl , because for me NONe of the codex Skidrow rips work but the same game by you or GOG,,,, works usually without a problem, and i reallly don&#039;t know why

btw your beautiful,  but you already knew that  lol]]></description>
