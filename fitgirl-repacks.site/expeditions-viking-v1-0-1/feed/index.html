		<description><![CDATA[I encountered my first bug in quest &quot;Ghosts of the Empire&quot;..where you have to eliminate the  two cult groups to gain favors from the monarch. I went to the map..eliminated the 2 cults, even eliminated few refugees in a side quest but the quest kept showing eliminate the 2nd cult also. I pissed off and uninstalled the game. However..it is a marvelous RPG if you enjoy turn based combat, only t be let down by stupid bugs.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[if you have the time, would love an updated repack of this, ma&#039;am.
1.04 is a lot more stable than the buggy original release, and I&#039;m dying to see how the rest of the story unfolds (its one of those rare games with a really engrossing story)

thank you again. your repack work remains the very best online.]]></description>
