		<description><![CDATA[Not the point.  There&#039;s multiple reasons for this which you fail to think about.  There is no &quot;contradiction&quot; - except in your mind.  You do realize ISOs rarely have compression and already are pre-packed/compressed a bit, right?

Looks like you&#039;re in the minority.  Time to take some of that &quot;15 TB&quot; money and buy another external for cheap - something that will take up 1%.  Think about that for a moment.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I am not missing anything.

Permanent benefit?  So is the install time.  So your smaller size is &quot;permanent&quot; and a faster install time is not?  Surely you jest.  What good is a game if someone stores but never installs it?  Sure, if they have clepto/&quot;must have it&quot; issues but not many people fall into that category.  

One download, one or more installs is another issue.  I notice this isn&#039;t brought up in your argument anywhere.  Maximum amount of times someone downloads a game should be ONE (barring exceptions).  Maximum amount of times someone plays the game?  Sure, for most it&#039;s one but many who store - which you have admitted - can play it multiple times.  There for, the &#062; 1:1 ratio applies and you can&#039;t just start comparing time versus time.  If you do, you have to apply the multiplicative factor to it.

Also, I bring up installs for another reason.  When installs fail - rare for me but others have this issue - why should someone sit there and to test his or her rig, install something multiple times with a substantial bloat?  It&#039;s why I brought up the diagnostic angle before.

You brought up your &quot;15 TB&quot; collection and yet you complain about a GB - and that isn&#039;t even the AVERAGE here.  Less than ONE GB on average will give a huge install benefit?  If you downloaded 100 repacks from FG, that&#039;s less than 2% of a 4 TB external - which costs around $100 or so.  Please.

Redundant sentence is redundant. Install time only matters during installation?  What&#039;s the definition of install again?  Come on now.  Again, I can use your argument against you:  &quot;It still doesn&#039;t explain why people need a smaller download.  They don&#039;t have to sit in front of the computers and wait for it to download.&quot;

Unpacked is the way to go?  We&#039;re not talking about nearly zero compression here so your &quot;example&quot; is a total miss.  Of course SOME compression is good and does not affect installation time &quot;much&quot;.  We&#039;re talking EXTREMES here.  If FG states a 1% to 5% in size will cause a 1.5 to 3x drop in time, that an outstanding tradeoff.

The whole purpose of a repack in not SOLELY size reduction.  Whoever told you this?  It&#039;s usually an AIO solution - especially when a game has a metric shitton of patches or a complicated setup process.  Usually, it&#039;s a fire and forget method of an install.  Smaller sizes are great and all - but if you believe a smaller size is the &quot;whole purpose&quot;, you need to read more than complaints in this forum.

We do not even know if her repacks will no longer be the smallest or not.  Besides, yes, her claim to fame was smallest repacks - but I&#039;ve come to know her for the quality, quantity and consistency.  I know the greatest hits of today and yesteryear will be here.

Lastly, and this is probably the most important part, FG is considering a change.  Why is that?  Apparently there has been enough commenting where she believes there may be enough interest - and judging by the poll results, she&#039;s right.  So as someone who looks to the public for *some* guidance, is she to look away from the majority?  There&#039;s an old saying, &quot;Screw with the majority and you will feel its impact.&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I just reinstalled Skyrim SE the day before yesterday after I uninstalled it in some time around May. And the other game I can remember reinstalling is Dark Souls 3. So, I don&#039;t exactly reinstall too many games. My bad, I picked the wrong wording. It&#039;s more like I collect game installers. COD: IW took ~2 hours to install (just EN, no MP &#038; Z), and I can wait just fine. A 4TB costs ~$160, and I feel that I can save it and spend on something else. Also, my average speed is ~700kbps, and it&#039;s considered decent enough in my country. Most of my friends have lower speeds than that.

Yup, not so simple after all. ^^]]></description>
