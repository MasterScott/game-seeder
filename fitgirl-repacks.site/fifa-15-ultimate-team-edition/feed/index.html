		<description><![CDATA[save as  fifasetup.ini and not fifasetup.txt or it will not work
AUDIO_MIX_MODE = 2
CONTROLLER_DEFAULT = 1
DISABLE_WINDAERO = 1
RENDERINGQUALITY = 2
RESOLUTIONHEIGHT = 1080
RESOLUTIONWIDTH = 1920
VOICECHAT = 0
WAITFORVSYNC = 0

change the resolution size to the size of your monitor.
The lower the rendering the worse / uglier the game becomes, but it will reduce lag significantly from older machines.  Turn off Windows Aero scheme  in Windows 7.  There is a bug in windows 7 that was never fixed from Windows Vista in terms of Aero. It can cause all kinds of really bad problems in some games, and also in video playback especially in Nvidia where you need to use an old driver (pre 350) to stop screen tearing / screen lag, in later windows this has gone.  The situation is very similar with AMD graphic cards too..neither company could be bothered to keep supporting windows 7 beyond a certain point when windows 8 came out,  this is why the problem returned.

As for the rendering quality, you can play around with it a bit, but my suggestion would be not to go over 4 on a low end machine without introducing the really bad lag and stuttering graphics. You might want to alter the sound by reducing it down to 1, on some systems sound as also played a role in causing some of the problems too.

For everyone else :  You must save this as fifasetup.ini  NOT fifasetup.ini.txt which many have done because they have not turned on their file extentions in folder settings. TURN IT ON, especially for security reasons!
When saving the ini file, simply type the name of the file with ini on the end , the below it select any files, and you can save it.  Put it in my documents fifa 15 and in the game folder where the settings are supposed to be.]]></description>
