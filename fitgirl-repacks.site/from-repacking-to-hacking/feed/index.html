		<description><![CDATA[I dunno, bout where you would really learn modern hacking techniques per say, but for repack info I like fileforums, most of the repack scene is frequent there and shares alot of knowledge and even automated toolsets to repack on your own. Well I guess you could actually call it recompress, as imo repack involves the extraction of pak files etc. and modification of the compressed images/audio etc then repackaging the original product with a smaller size then further compression with the various chain compression utilities that exist. It is not so hard to figure out with a bit of reading and trial and error, but then to do your own modified .dll and build compression exe from source that is where the tough part can come in to play, I am just thankful for the freely distributed scripts etc that exist on fileforums and I repack not for clicks or any monetary gains as I already make plenty myself but rather I do it to help folks with either super slow internet and/or very low data caps on their service or maybe their govt restricts their people from buying certain games with censorship etc. I am thankful for where I live and the fact I don&#039;t have all those probs, so for me it is a way to give back to the community I get cracked games which saves me $$ so I send out what I can when I can to help folks who are less fortunate, and that is how it is meant to be, I am 33 and I have been somewhat involved in the Warez scene for most of my life although I tend to be behind the scenes mostly. I hate to see what it has morphed into over the years, in the early years everything was easily accessible but you had to know where to look &#038; we certainly weren&#039;t forcing our fans to go through all these popups nor did we typically have to host on 3rd party servers. We mostly utilized private ftp servers and mIRC bots to handle our distribution. Now all the sites almost want to break the games  into like 20-30 parts and make you go through popup hell for each file, the scene was not meant to be that way but as my generation slowly departs from it I see it more and more. I just want to say to the newbs find a way to keep it free as it was always meant to be, don&#039;t whine about cracks being harder to find and perhaps start learning how they work in the first place, and maybe trying yourselves would be a better option than complaining about something you get for free, just hate to see the sniveling ungrateful kids out there. Knowledge is power and with that power their is no limit to what your young minds can achieve, their is no such thing as impossible when it comes to DRM methods, at least not that I have ever seen...they have certainly made it a bit harder to do with the implementation of denuvo but even that is failing to protect as well as it once did. Sorry...rant over and take care to all.]]></description>
