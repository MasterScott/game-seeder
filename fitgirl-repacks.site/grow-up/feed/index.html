Just reinstalled everything (Windows, Progs etc) And people on forums are claiming its from gas guzzlers, I installed  the one with 2 dlc...  Anyway&#039;s will just stick to official release&#039;s from codex etc... Thanks for all the games over the years, but not taking the risk again...

Anyway&#039;s big thanks for all the games over the past couple of years and best of luck ;)]]></description>
