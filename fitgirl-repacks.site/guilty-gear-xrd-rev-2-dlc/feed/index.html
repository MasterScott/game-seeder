		<description><![CDATA[Yeah maybe I bad at fighting games, but I&#039;ve played a lot of them already..like MKX, MK9, SF4, Injustice, SFXTekken etc...but this game feels a bit anime or cartoony to me. Maybe that&#039;s the USP of the game donno. The game has 2 modes-Stylish and Technical. If you opt for Stylish you can put the hardest difficulty and win the game easily just mashing 1 button continuously as the AI automatically performs combos for you in this mode. However on Technical mode, you have to actually perform the combos by pressing exact buttons as per the guide and it&#039;s not AI driven. Like you said already, the game is probably the hardest to master or even understand on technical mode compared to other games. I&#039;m not complaining..just saying the whole graphics for me look like hand made cartoons and design..completely different to MKX, Injustice etc. where characters look and feel real like their skin and their sweat. Here it is very anime..just my opinion. Still a very good fighting game.]]></description>
