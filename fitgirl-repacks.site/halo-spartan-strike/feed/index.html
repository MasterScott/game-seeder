		<description><![CDATA[Hey :) 
I wanted to download this game, However the sole download site provided is probably not working. 
Even after translation there are four options for downloading torrent. 
While 2 of them bring me to a software called Zona&#039;s main page.. 
The rest 2 download a torrent which is sketchy as hell. It is about 1.75 mb. 
and I&#039;m very skeptical of the same, so incase you have this, it would be amazing if you could reupload it to some other mirror. Thankyou In advance. And as always, I appreciate your work so much.

With profound regards, 
Negi]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello,
The repacks are great however since KAT has been shut down, I am unable to download many of these packs. The third party russian sites do not allow me to download the torrents, even after translating the webpage I have ended up downloading 3 rar files packed with some random exe that is likely a virus. I hope you can post a magnet link to this game, as well as DiRt 3, and a few others, or please fix the only available link to include a simple download torrent button without leading to a virus/malware from pop ups. Thanks]]></description>
