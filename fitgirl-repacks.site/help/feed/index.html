		<description><![CDATA[&quot;i sent this message few times in rise of the tomb raider post, but nothing happens when click post comment.&quot;

Hi FitGirl
First of all, forgive me for weakness in writing in English and thanks for amazing repacks.
i can&#039;t pm you on sites in contact page because of their limitation for new users.
last year i tricked one of my university&#039;s computer so that seed your torrents until 20:1 ratio with 10MB speed.
now i graduated i can&#039;t do that again but i  can upload your repacks to FileCorn server that has no ads or timer or speed limit.
for ROTTR i upload the files you share as mirror so anyone can use my uploads as mirror to. i only just rename parts to &quot;Rise of the Tomb Raider [FitGirl Repack]&quot;.
i made profile in filecorn to just upload your repacks(the links is set as Website in comment Form).this link it shows every file i upload.for now i upload 12 parts of ROTTR. other parts are uploading.
PS:Are you let me set FileCorn profile avatar to your avatar?]]></description>
