		<description><![CDATA[This is my last post!
I have already downloaded other repacks and never had the same problem as yours. Why? Because they didn&#039;t provide the option to download one or some languages or some additional bonus content. They just didn&#039;t include that! They said that this is our repack, take it or leave it! But, i guess this is kinda your trademark right? Being the smallest repacker for video games? So, in your mind, you should provide the optional download of other languages and bonus content in order to give the smallest file possible even if it ruins any future updating process. A trickery at progress!
Other repackers provide them as it is, at a manageable file size and NOT at maximum compression because, they know that NOT ALL PEOPLE HAVE SSD&#039;S. Simply because you are full of ssd&#039;s doesn&#039;t mean that other people have them too. Most people have tradition HDDS. SSDS are way to expensive and you saying that it is someone&#039;s problem/fault that takes to much time to install a game is for laughs. For example, take your Act Of Aggression Reboot repack! How much time did you say it needs to install? I don&#039;t remember but, i guess fewer than the 6,5 hours i wasted on your repack. And yes yes i don&#039;t have an archaic system, i just don&#039;t have ssds. Base your releases on what people HAVE and KNOW. Don&#039;t base them on what YOU have and what YOU know!!!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Please go and use other repacks in the future, OK?

I will NEVER remove selective options due to people like you can&#039;t think.

Also only delta-patches don&#039;t work and it&#039;s not the majority of the patches available.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I stronly believe that you must remove this option that says that you have the ability to desselect excess languages and bonus content from your releases because, at the end if someone does that, would ALWAYS end up with an unpatchable repack (well if he/she desselected all these in the downloading phase) . It also creates confusion when you are telling people that they have this viable option only to criticize them shortly afterwards if they did!
Ps. When you say that you can desselect other languages and bonus content without warning others for the consequences by doing so, MEANS that there is nothing wrong and that there will be NO IMPLICATIONS for future patching ;-)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You are providing the information that we have the option to desselect excess languages and bonus content from downloading and installing but, you are NOT providing the information that, by doing so, you render your game completely unoperable for future patching. And then, you go by insulting us for being dumb controllable drones by not be able to realize that? This is not an FBI investigation! And we also didn&#039;t born with the inherited gift to be clairvoyants.  Why are you getting to trouble to include so much information in detail for your repacks and fail to add one more but such a vital one? I am sorry but, your last response was unconsiderable and irresponsible!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So, Russian people for example, who don&#039;t speak nor understand English have the right to play the game in their language, and by doing so, they will ALWAYS (they will never need it so why bother downloading or installing it) have to desselect the English language and thus, rendering their game incompatible for future updates? Did you at least warn them for that? I am just saying. My whole argument and don&#039;t get me wrong, is based on the sole idea that people SHOULD be informed for the options they have!]]></description>
