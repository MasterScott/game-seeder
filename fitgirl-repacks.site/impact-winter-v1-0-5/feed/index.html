		<description><![CDATA[LOL! Had loaded up TWOM &#039;the little ones&#039; to relive the horrors of war and right before your post the small child i&#039;m watching out for (on 2nd day, no way to protect unless i didn&#039;t scavenge) greets me with &#039;Daddy, some scary men came! I started screaming and they hit me really hard!&#039; Unfucking real, nothing else like it]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I really don&#039;t know what sucked me in, either lol. I&#039;ve never even cared for other games of the same type (don&#039;t starve, etc.). While this game is depressing for its own reasons (horrible development), This War of Mine is a tough recommendation: its so well made but holy shit, what a bummer it is to play! If you&#039;re doing well, you probably had to fuck over some other poor soul unless you&#039;re just having a perfect &#039;run.&#039; Still a must-experience, though, totally agree.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[what an unplayable piece of crap! optimized unity (the game unpacked and installed quicker than it took for a level to load!), incomprehensible gameplay, bizarre controls and utterly retarded safehouse system and characters! just play &quot;this war of mine&quot; if you love the survival-exploration adventure games]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m playing with a controller, but just a note: this game is jacked the fuck up. I can&#039;t believe they released it in this state. I&#039;m playing with a controller and it&#039;s still a pain in the ass. The collision detection is positively laughable(your guy will get stuck on anything, and the snowmobile, which I thought was gonna be awesome, will crash on fucking nonexistent objects every 2 seconds of driving). Various quests are broken and can&#039;t be completed. I&#039;ve purchased a number of games I&#039;ve played on this site after &#039;testing&#039; them(Prey and Nier, most recently), and when they finally get their fucking act together I&#039;ll get this one too, but it has a way to go. I wouldn&#039;t even download until they patch the hell out of it(but it&#039;s not a large game so what the heck). So much potential, gonna keep my eye on this one.]]></description>
