		<description><![CDATA[Either it is not cracked properly or not a proper release.
You can download it from 3DM yourself n see how many time it freezes n crashes within 3 minutes.
There&#039;s always a reason if fitgirl never repack it (nor never mention it in upcoming repack section) while other lame ass repackers does]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi FitGirl,
Could you please address the virus detection in UNINS000 discussed below by me (T.o.m.) and Phantomsectre(who found issues with other recent releases of your also).

I would like to play this game, but it&#039;s the only one you&#039;ve posted that was flagged by my anti-virus, so I am hesitant to install.

Cheers.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[No, not a false positive.  The code is there, as I dissembled it.  This is the first time Sentinel One has snagged a Trojan from any of FitGirl&#039;s repacks.  The uninstall program is just a generic program that executes the uninstall script, so why alter it?  One reason...  to pass a trojan.  No offense to FitGirl as I would never believe her to do something like this on purpose.  She should check her system, because afterward, I found three other recent (released in the last few days) repacks that contain the EXACT same code, but in different EXE&#039;s.  &quot;generic&quot; doesn&#039;t necessarily mean its a false positive.  It just means the antivirus app found trojan code that has not been identified and added to the database yet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[New seeding ratio for smaller games will be 50:1 since they become well seeded right away and the throughput starts dragging.  Well, that, and you pump out the releases pretty quickly now. :o
