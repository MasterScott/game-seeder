		<description><![CDATA[hey, I gave it some time, cause what you said wasn&#039;t true, but I&#039;d like to confirm now, since you replied to my comment, that I&#039;m still getting pop ups etc even though I have registered there.

Maybe you have a VIP status or premium account group which could explain why you don&#039;t get pop ups but I do?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[yeah since I saw Fitgirl advertising for this some months page, and because I really loved the old version, I checked it out.

But it&#039;s nothing like the old version, for a start, it&#039;s FULL of SPAM and suspicious behaviour, all kinds of pop ups and pop ups that try to prevent you from closing them.

Also my antivirus is going crazy &quot;threat detected&quot;  &quot;threat detected&quot; &quot;threat detected&quot; &quot;threat detected&quot; &quot;threat detected&quot; all the time.

None of this happened on the old version, I&#039;m staying clear of this one.]]></description>
