		<description><![CDATA[lol...you can crank the settings to Ultra with any card, I&#039;m far more interested in what kind of FPS you&#039;re getting in the games you listed (GTA 5, Skyrim, Arma 3, Fallout 4, etc.).

Take GTA V for example, in most of the benchmarks I&#039;ve seen a 1050 TI averages about 40-45 FPS on Ultra settings.  You&#039;re never going to hit 60, and rarely even over 50. Same deal with Battlefield 1. With Arma 3 though, you&#039;ll barely get above 30 FPS on Ultra, and that&#039;s in single player. This is all at 1080p, of course. Respectable for a $130 card, but nowhere NEAR the best cost to performance ratio. That would be the the 1070, IMO, which will give you a solid 60+ FPS in all but the most demanding games, and even with demanding games, dips below 60 FPS are far and few in between. With a card like the 1050 Ti, you&#039;ll either have to sacrifice graphical fidelity or FPS, and if you&#039;re playing something that&#039;s both demanding AND poorly optimized (Arma 3, any Ubisoft game, etc.) you&#039;ll be stuck with console tier FPS on max settings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Do you guys remember when Denuvo came out? They put a hold on some of the biggest games for a good while.  Most of us just thought that was it and any any game with Denuvo would just be considered uncrackable. Then CPY came and opened the door. But one group can&#039;t do it all. The more people we can support doing this kind of work, the more games we can get. 
You don&#039;t have to send much to help! Hell, send $1! send $5! Whatever you can afford.

Even if you have no idea on how Bitcoin works, it&#039;s really simple to buy some coins and send them.

Just go to https://www.bitcoin.com/buy-bitcoin

Or go here and read a short step by step tutorial (using a phone app, super easy)
http://www.businessinsider.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin-using-coinbase-2017-2

Send the coins to: 15fxay2J19CZeZHGg1xrwhbQLU37RAhwzN

Thanks for the hard work Baldman!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Exactly, i just got one for like 130$ bucks plus tax and shipping 2 months ago, was like maybe 160-170$ and it plays every game Ive tried on Ultra settings no joke. GTA 5, Skyrim, Arma 3, Fallout 4, Farcry 4, Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1, War Thunder, World of Tanks etc.. etc...

I cant even fathom why you would buy anything else right now, money for money, a gtx1080 isn&#039;t much better, but yet its 4 times the cost as a 1050ti. On heroes and Generals I get 130-140 frames per second which is very, very rare for people to get over 80FPS and 
I hear people saying they got i7 kabylake unlocked 7700k to 5.5 gigs with GTX1080 gards and still  with 130-140FPS and that game is very taxing on a CPU and GPU Just go download it and see for yourself, Heroes and Generals plays better on Ultra then on low/minimum settings because of the CPU doing 1/2 the work, its a strange game setup that way, but go see what your Frames are and compare to the 1050ti.

GTX1050ti is the winner of the year in GPU&#039;s... I would even go as far to say its the best GPU money to cost to performance in the past decade if not longer... Its not the best card, plz dont confuse that, its just the best priced card and you will not be disappointed. FACT!!!!!!!!]]></description>
