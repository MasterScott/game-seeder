		<description><![CDATA[I started using qbittorrent. Was using uTorrent for years but read in one post in Toms Hardware I think, that some people experienced malware issues. Not sure why that was the case. Anyway I found this to be good. 
Also if anyone has issue with using torrent there is a website called - www.bytesloader.com where one can upload the magnet link. There are two issues on this site though. One they use lots of popups and warn you about popupblocker. So for that I use Firefox browser with uBlockOrigin addon. It works like a charm once your torrent link files are generated. Second it at times takes good amount of time to download the torrent. Hence if you can add tracker while adding the torrent link, it might work for you. I uploaded Fitgirl Mafia 3 above version and it provided me the file within few hours. Plus they store it for few days so you have time to download it. The download to PC each file separetely is free but if you want to download as zip it charges 2dollar a month. The download page goes through Linkshare where the uBlockOrigin popupblocker displays its true power :D
 Thought it might be helpful for someone.]]></description>
