		<description><![CDATA[I loved reading that little snippet about Fitgirl and how she came to love repacks.
When I was younger and had access to multiple private FTPs, it was always so fucking awesome
when someone did a decent job with their compression. I remember downloading Quake 2 on my
dialup and being so stoked that it was only going to take about 2  days.

Anyway, thank you for what you do. It&#039;s appreciated countless times a day by all of us that download
your repacks. Keep it up!!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[UPDATE [10/6 / 6PM PT]: We currently have a patch running here at the studio that includes 30, 60, and unlimited frames-per-second options in the video menu, among other improvements for the PC version of Mafia III. We’re verifying the patch now to ensure everything is working as expected. If everything goes well, we expect the update to go live this weekend. We will be keeping the PC community up-to-date on the status of the patch throughout the weekend and thank you for all the feedback!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[This weekend they should release an update for Mafia 3 which removes the 30fps lock and also gives other options for pc users.

Crackers should wait with uploading the game till they can include this update in it because without this update the game isnt really worth it on pc]]></description>
