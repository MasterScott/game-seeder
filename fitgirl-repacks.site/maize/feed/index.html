		<description><![CDATA[Hey guys, we have the same issue. The loading screen after clicking new game is just freezing.. its loading infinite. I tried everything including what was mentioned below here. 
Can somebody upload a saved game file for me from the beginning. I thought if its not generating it by itself, I just put a file there and maybe it can load in from that. 
Help pls guys I wants to play with Maize :(]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[actually my previous comment had nothing to do with anti-virus reports. i use a packet watcher  when i install anything so i can see every file and registry addition it makes. after triple checking things i can say without  a doubt that this Maize release does contain malware. i&#039;m sure it was not your intent, nor am i stating this for random inflammatory reasons. just trying to help you out and keep your rep shiny. i&#039;d  imagine you use similar tools and can see the same results if you check it out. for fun i did just let it install again freely then rebooted and ran malwarebytes to see if it picked up the virus and it mostly did though traces remained. no idea about any other av crap though. cheers and thanks for helping us check out the game as well as for your insights on compression.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[actually this unpacked quite a nasty trojan generator. please try to recheck your source on this one as it seems to be infested. fitgirl repacks are normally quite trustworthy, but this release is  no bueno. I&#039;ve checked the pre-install md5 and post install hash which come out correct so it is packed into your release. it would be nifty if you could fix this one. (the virus is bad enough even if one knows how  to fix stuff. )]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[So far nothing, short of installing it on another computer.
I even tried uninstalling my antivirus in case it was blocking a file somewhere, and nothing.

Maybe someone will have more luck than me, but for now I give up on this one.]]></description>
