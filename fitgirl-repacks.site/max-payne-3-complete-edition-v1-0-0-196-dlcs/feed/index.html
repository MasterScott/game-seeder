		<description><![CDATA[OK for everyone stuck with CLS-srep_x64.exe problem.

There is an alternative installer located here
http://sendfile.su/1317253
press download and get the file (it is called setup_new.exe) 
Note : DO NOT get the file linked right under with the following &quot;FitGirl 2017-03-13 18:26:17 New installer! Http://file-7.ru/download/skakatid&quot;. This file does not work and is named max_payne_3_complete_edition_novyy_ustanovshchik_96a-fb3.

Run setup and the problem is gone.
I can confirm the game installed correctly 19/08/2017. Good luck all.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s cool. we all sometimes overlook stuff when your in a hurry to get something working like this ;) ; but i am just amazed how they manage to shrink games to about half of their size (or even less than half) as it&#039;s basically like FLAC is for audio cd&#039;s as that typically shrinks audio cd&#039;s to about half of their original size without lowering audio quality. normally you can&#039;t even come close to that kind of compression on games with typical compression tools like 7-Zip/WinRAR which are the most common compression programs. because with those typical tools compressing a games ISO file is so little in file savings it&#039;s simply not worth compressing them as it just wastes time (even compressing the installed game, while that usually helps some, it&#039;s still not all that much space savings) but whatever FitGirl is doing works wonders and makes it worth your time. so basically you got two choices now... get the standard ISO scene release of a game and use more hard drive space but have faster installs or get releases like FitGirl and have less to download (and will save you some hard drive space) but much longer game installs. but it&#039;s probably safer to stick to the standard scene ISO released games in general simply because stuff is less likely to act up during installation. but if someone has a fair amount of games to get and wants to keep backups then releases like FitGirl can be a nice way to save plenty of hard drive space. so each has their ups and downs. but i have not had any issues so far on the couple of games i installed from FitGirl.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I have no AV installed, Defender not active and get the same error. The same old answer &quot; your AV blocked/deleted it&quot; is pure shit. I don&#039;t know the reason but this is not true. I have four PC with win10 and the same game (max payne 3 copied from the same PC) works on three and not on one. By the way the PC where I get &quot;gsrld.dll failed to load&quot; has an AMD CPU (Phenom x4 965 BE). All the Visual C++ redistributable libraries (x86 - x64) are installed.]]></description>
