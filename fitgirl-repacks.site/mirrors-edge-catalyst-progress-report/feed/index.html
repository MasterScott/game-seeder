		<description><![CDATA[&lt;blockquote&gt;
  and also i canâ€™t imaging how could a repack be stolen since game files should be the same as the original
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Not in case of LEGO games, which, well, never been repacked with small size and yet untouched file structure.

As for taking my stuff for other repacks - I don&#039;t have anything against it if proper credits are given. I did it myself with one crack from RG Mechanics (I&#039;ve asked them before, but it doesn&#039;t really matter).

Bad thing is only when stuff is taken withour crediting, as Corepack do.

Thanks for clarification, I have nothing against you and your group, send my best regards to Razor :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[please not that i have nothing to do with this
the past 8 months i was busy with work so i left everything related to dzrt to Mik3y
to take care of things until i get back

i never heard of this Lego Star Wars &quot;story&quot; before 
and also i can&#039;t imaging how could a repack be stolen since  game files should be the same as the original 
 i never tried to get the batter size ever sometimes i have to sacrifice 1Gb gain in compression to gain time and also unpack speed
since i dont want to delay for days for just 1/2GB

any way&#039;s as i said before  i&#039;m not sure About Lego Star Wars Since am not the one who worked on it however i&#039;m Sorry if this true .

LEGO STAR WARS post has been deleted until i investigate this matter.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Found it, it was a post on your wall @KAT:

&quot;Dear mik3y from DZ Team. I know you&#039;re reading this (cause you&#039;ve stolen my repack). Of course it ain&#039;t news for you, but you&#039;re an impotent. You&#039;re lousy repacker (&quot;recompressed&quot; my Lego Star Wars from 6.3 to 6.6 GB, wow) and a measly liar (your repack based not on CODEX release, but on my repack).&quot;

Coliotte is an admin and uploader for DZ stolen repacks and they still have their ill-gotten goods up for grabs:

Nice group you are commending, Franked. Any other thieves that you like?]]></description>
