		<description><![CDATA[So the &quot;objectifying of women&quot; isn&#039;t sexist to you? Lol I don&#039;t mind it because the games like Dead or alive are really fun and I feel if you like cute/sexy characters in games then that&#039;s why you play it. 
Being upset about it is like being mad people are gay imo.  I feel denying Dev&#039;s freedoms restricts the industry and put&#039;s creativity in a box. Like for instance.....Because of being afraid of every journalist and their mother calling a game racist we will never be able to play a game that humanizes a German soldier during WWII because nobody can stand one American soldier being shot even if the story is about something more personal and dramatic and less about the war.....   The persona series does a good job at being a series that covers topics but even they won&#039;t touch a lot of these topics. Well they touched on sexual assault I guess but you get it lol.]]></description>

Have you played SW-4 empires? I actually think it&#039;s decent compared to every empires released so far besides SW2 empires. Nothing surpasses that game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for post this game

Anyway, I NEED HELP PLEASE

I can begin with the game perfectly, but when I try to enter in the first dungeon (when I finally get control), the game simply close. No error message, simply close

Have someone seen this or know how resolve?]]></description>
