		<description><![CDATA[Hi Fitgirl can you help me.. I am in desperate need, I have some issues in the Managerial career. At the 16th race (Australia) in Moto3 the game crashes and there is no way to keep going with the Managerial career. I have seen that theoretically the new patch should fix some issues related to this career mode and maybe including the oneI am experiencing. Do you have any suggestion or maybe you could upload a new repack with the patch included? Thanks]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[i don&#039;t know but prob not because virtually everything i get from here works, but i havn&#039;t dloaded this main reason is because it vastly inferior to another similar game on here

Ride 2....if you havn&#039;t already got it, it blows this away, only downside is no licences..
http://fitgirl-repacks.site/ride-2-2-dlc/  also dirt 4 blows wrc6 away...

you&#039;ll thank me later...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Found the fix for random crashes

Make sure to play the MotoGP 17.exe not the MotoGP 17 x64.exe and make sure to play it on a compatibility mode to windows 7 even you’re in windows 7 , after i did that , i didnt experience random crashes anymore]]></description>
