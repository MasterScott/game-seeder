		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s because it requires steam access. What you downloaded was just the raw files. To see real names and logos, etc requires one to be connected to steam through the game to get the final part of the mod. The creators of the mods make them for original games and not cracked games.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, FitGirl you are the best!!!

I download your MM v1.3.13194 + 3 DLC and it works absolutly nice!

...but...
I have problems with some Mods I already find in different websites... 
I replace the file &quot;resources.assets&quot; file in the correct folder of my windows setup... but cannot see the originals names and logos as the mods file promised... What I do wrong???

Did you have any mods with original names and logos for this version already??

Thank you in advance!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I don&#039;t know why all the comments talks about patch 1.1 what was released November 2016 and consider an old patch.

This repack version includes the most recent patch 1.3 what was just released together with the dlc. (check out steam discussion)

So this repack includes all the old patches include the most recent patch v1.3]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[The problem with that site is, they bring the mods out too late, and the game has been patched,  this always includes the api&#039;s which the mods use.  If the people who made the mods, actually made them faster, they would find that their mods work in the latest releases.   You can&#039;t use the mods in backward comparability, unless you can find the exact rip of the game that works with the mod.

There is little point asking on here for help, you best bet is to ask for help on the actual mod site, and it would be best if you said nothing about your pirated version of the game too. As you can see on their site and in particular that mod as problems with the latest update, but then all motorsport mods have problems with latest patches, as mentioned because they need to update the api the patches use, this changes its number and the patch stops working because its no longer compatible.]]></description>
