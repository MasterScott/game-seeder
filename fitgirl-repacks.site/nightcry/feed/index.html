		<description><![CDATA[I tried updating this (unknown version) repack with Codex cracked updates. With the updates &#038; cracks applied, the game wouldn&#039;t work (as I expected) but with updates applied using the original crack supplied with this repack, the game loaded, but the bugs/problems/errors are still there.

This is literally the only Fitgirl repack I&#039;ve tried (out of many) that doesn&#039;t work properly &#038; has game breaking bugs. I&#039;m going to uninstall this and try the Codex non-repack version and see if that one has the same problems.

Fitgirl, any idea on whats causing these bugs or how to fix them? Any advice would be really appreciated...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks but which version of the game is this, and can it be updated? The game works okay up until chapter 3 where the game stops tracking your progress and checkpoints stop saving, also the phone chargers don&#039;t charge your phone anymore (which is a game breaking bug because it means you can&#039;t use the phone features or the torch anymore, and you need both to complete the game).

Can you help me out here? Can I apply one of the Codex updates or one of the 3DM ones? If so, where can I find them. Google doesn&#039;t seem to bring up anything except foreign sites with dead or private trackers/torrents.

Please help, I want to keep playing this game!]]></description>
