		<description><![CDATA[@naakacementerio:disqus - I&#039;ve asked the same thing also, but I&#039;m aware she (FitGirl) can only upload a repack if someone cracks it first. Bladman, cracked all other versions of, Prey (2017), so he is the guy we are waiting on.

		<description><![CDATA[@UberZer0:disqus - Hey, you are not alone. There is a known issue with v1.04 on PC, cracked and non-cracked versions, whereby the audio is totally messed up. Some, like you, have no voice audio at all, and other like me have deafening, ear bleedingly loud voices that sound like someone screaming directly into your ears. Plus the voice volume slider is broken and does almost nothing.
I currently have Windows master volume turned down to 40% and the in-game voice volume set to 1%, yes 1% (one), and still NPC voices sound distorted and are extremely loud to the point of making it unplayable.

Just hope that, Baldman who cracked all other versions, also cracks the 1.05 update too.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[@disqus_XI7CofqbYu:disqus  - Have you heard anything regarding the new v1.05 update for; Prey (2017), whether anyone will try to crack it??

*Reason being, there is a huge audio issue with this current version, v1.04, so it&#039;s barely playable, but v1.05 apparently fixes the issue, so many people are waiting and hoping for it.]]></description>
