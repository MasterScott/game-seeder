		<description><![CDATA[The issue is clearly a personal one. i dont think Ive had 4 with that issue out of what feels like 400 ive gotten from fit.... That being said, in your &quot;one last attempt to connect&quot;, you take the time to write a pointless few lines to patronize &#038; boast....but you give Z E R O info about your system. lol... its goofy enough to genuinely expect a personal response, but to write a block of strange text like that and not give any info that could actually be used to help you...come on man...lol]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What errors? pics please you said a lot but you did not even say anything about the crash, bug,error specifically, What errors man
What OS?, x86(32bit)?, x64(64bit)?
Graphics Card?

Basic Noodles
1) Install All Microsoft Visual C++ from 2000 - 2015 (x86 &#038; x64) (most games need this)
2) Install Direct X directx_Jun2010_redist v9.29.1974
2.5) (Optional) Install DirectX SDK or Windows Kit (WindowsSDK) (I recommend installing it.. but still optional)
3) Install All dot NET Framework 1.0 - 4.7 (most games need this)
4) Microsoft XNA Framework 2.0, 3.1, 4.0 (few games use this but install it anyway because reasons)
5) Update you Graphics Driver (Mandatory)

these are the fn basic things i do

and I NEVER GET an ERROR or FitGirl Repacks ever

just kidding i still get unarc.dll error
i sometimes rehash 
(but sometimes i just retry re-installing and it works don&#039;t know why)

and don&#039;t get any reply that often because not only you post same shit everyday]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear FitGirl,
this is the 4th game i have installed from your site, it is also the 4th that gave me a crash/fatal error msg , i have wrote you several times about these games hoping for some instruction on to way or how, so far you have not responded to non... 
and i do know you are a human being, you have your own life, i respect you greatly, i have even donated money to kat trough  your page / link when it got shutdown, yet i have not gotten any responses from you to any of does messages and it has been more then 2 weeks...
so i am writing this massage, one last attempt to connect maybe even just to get an &quot;i dont know&quot; just to know that you are even aware of this
to be honest i dont know way but its really strange, in the past i had little to no problems with your packes, they were great, but now every one for the last month or so has been a dad

whoever reads this, hope you have better luck then me]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What a quick response!
So that goes for all your &lt;em&gt;multipart-archive&lt;/em&gt; versions of you repacks? They&#039;re all supposed to be extracted with WinRAR 5 or newer? Maybe you should add it to the FAQ.
Btw thank you for all those repacks and keep it up, you rock!]]></description>
