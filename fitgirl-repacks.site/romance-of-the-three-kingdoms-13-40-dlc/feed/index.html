		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s most likely the original version of the game. The website is in Korean, so it&#039;s either in that language or Chinese, or both... so we&#039;ll then have the prob of not knowing what were are clicking and what the characters are saying.
If it does work, it could, in theory, be the version used, all we need is to find someone to &#039;translate&#039;. The problem isn&#039;t so much as to what put where, since we already have the English version of the game, but the actual doing it. So, unless someone from Skidrow, etc, does it, or Fitgirl even, it&#039;ll just be a dead end sadly...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hello FitGirl, hope you are doing well.
First of, I wanted to thank you for all the hard work, you&#039;re awesome!

I am, however, a bit confused, does this version have Fame and Strategy? &#039;Cause in the screenshots the game version presented is the one with the expansion (PUK). 
If yes, is there a way to download it seperately? (I already have the game, so downloading the base game again is a bit of a nuisance)

If the game does not have PUK yet, do you have any idea if it&#039;s possible to crack it or not? Any info would be nice since CrackWatch has nothing on this game or the PUK]]></description>
