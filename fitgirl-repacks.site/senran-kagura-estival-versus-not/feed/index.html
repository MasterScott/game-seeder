		<description><![CDATA[I find the reaction to the poll kind of funny, even poetic. The poll was created because some people didn&#039;t read the FAQ. And since day one there has been people who has been criticising (is that a word?) FitGirl herself for making the poll and letting us decide what she uploads or not... and that&#039;s the funny part. She didn&#039;t say that. Here&#039;s a copy&#038;paste:

&quot;As some of you may know, I decided not to make the repack of Senran Kagura: Estival Versus, cause many different users requested it here and there without even trying to read my FAQ.

But maybe I’m too harsh to them and shouldn’t punish for their gaming desires? Tell me your opinion.&quot;

Read again the last 4 words. See my point? She never asked what to do, she just asked for opinions, not directives. And that&#039;s the poetic part: People don&#039;t read FAQs so that leads to the creation of a poll that also leads to people not reading the poll. This is art, I&#039;m crying right now. This is too beautiful not to cry for. Tears of beauty!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Why bother with the poll if not to tease a certain fanbase, and are you going to do this whenever a release matches with a title someone previously requested? If you are able to repack, do it; if it is not priority, so be it. People are going to annoyingly request games and people are also annoyingly going to vote not to repack because the game doesn&#039;t interest them personally or to get on their moral high horse as appeasers who&#039;d lick your piss off the floor given the chance. I understand that no one is entitled here but it is not good to punish those who have been patient and rule-abiding. Have a nice day. PS I want to f*** your brains out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Perhaps the pont here wasnt to see how many people wanted it over those who didnt, but instead to see how many people actually want it in general. Clearly there is a handful of people that do, well over 9000 in fact, and thats counting the ones only from this site.

If it was 10% vs 90% than im sure she wouldnt have bothered with it, but 45% nearly half, kinda speaks for itself.]]></description>
