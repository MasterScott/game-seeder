		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s not about math, it&#039;s about GOG, for some reason, using different version numbering in one place (i.e. 2.2.0.6 in their patch-file filenames ) and the standard-version numbering in other places (i.e. 1.1.2.0 in the ui of the patch-files).

As I said in an earlier post:

&quot;GOG patch 2.2.0.6 = Steam patch 1.1.2.0 and is the 1st patch and there are thus no “previous patches”
After that came
GOG 2.3.0.7 = Steam 1.1.3.0
GOG 2.4.0.8 = Steam 1.1.4.0&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ok first, i would surely have to revisit my math again since elementary school. I guess 2 &#060; 1. Ok whatever. Second, if you are sure that GOG update v2.2.0.6 should be applied first after you have downloaded and installed the WHOLE repack from Fitgirl and it doesn&#039;t work, then Fitgirl messed up her release pretty bad and it&#039;s unpatchable! No real news for me to be sincere!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all, GOG update v2.2.0.6 is not the equivalent of this workaround patch v1.1.2.0. You mean that you have tried all GOG patches and the last patch v2.2.0.6 failed? If it did, then stop updating a previous patch before v2.2.0.6 and just wait for a new one! (for example if you applied the GOG v1.1.5.0 and worked then stop there and don&#039;t try to update to v2.2.0.6)
You don&#039;t apply GOG update v2.2.0.6 first! 
Ps. The checksums you mention is an indication that the files that need to be patched are not the correct ones and there is some deviation. That is why, they are not getting accepted from the patch.
Again, this is a workaround patch fix to Codex version and not an official patch FROM Codex themselves.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[That&#039;s what i initially tried to do, but the 2.2.0.6. (v1.1.2.0) GOG update dosen&#039;t work either.

With the patch here i was able to transform the pc_arch_thumbs.bin and pc_arch_scripts.bin files, but pc_arch_common.bin failed.

And i have learned that pc_arch_common.bin should have checksum cb149843a357932b973a3d921cc8a0c5 AFTER the transformation. The CODEX 1.1.3.0 patch expects this.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There is also GOG Update v1.1.5.0
Look, the GOG patches located in extratorrent didn&#039;t upload in the same order as they were released.
Meaning, GOG patch v2.2.0.6 came first, then v1.1.3.0, v1.1.4.0 and lastly v1.1.5.0.
From basic logic i would personally have tried to apply v1.1.3.0 then v1.1.4.0 and go on....

try it and tell me]]></description>
