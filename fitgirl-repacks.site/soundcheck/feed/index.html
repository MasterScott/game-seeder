		<description><![CDATA[On the Download page in the &quot;Development binary builds&quot; section, I downloaded &quot;opus-tools 0.1.9&quot; and &quot;opusfile 0.7&quot;, and the Stable release of &quot;libopus 1.1.3&quot;... Whenever I open an &quot;.exe&quot; file in one of these Opus folders, I just get a Run box that quickly appears and disappears. Are these Opus tools to be used in some other third-party software like Audacity or VirtualDub???]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I easily noticed that the first one was the lossy one, a couple of  listens with a good pair of headphones and you will notice that the bass is crispy.

But the lossy version is still very high quality so there is no need for original files!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[After listening it on a good pair of phones you can tell the first one was a little bit &quot;muddier&quot;, the bass being louder covering some brightness of it. But for my personal taste, I ended up liking it too, I wouldnt mind any of both versions on a game.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Opus was encoded with default settings (they are good), it had to be processed by LossyWav for technical reasons, but LW is also considered transparent. As for data above 20 KHz, it may be an artifacts effect of LossyWav. And you should know that anything above 20 KHz is hardly noticable by majority of people, that&#039;s why lossy codecs kills hi-freqs the first :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[nice. i just checked and the lossy file compressed better in flac than the lossless one (ratios of 0.427 for 1.wav and 0.581 for 2.wav, both at flac 5). i wonder what settings you used for the opus encoding, seeing as when i tested i couldn&#039;t get near the same compression ratio in flac and the spectograms look a lot cleaner above 20kHz.
your file: 1. wav https://i.imgur.com/wSPY9ml.png
opus encoded at 96kHz from 2.wav https://i.imgur.com/KrzLDDq.png
notice that the first images contains a lot more data above 20kHz, while the second contains very little (dark background).]]></description>
