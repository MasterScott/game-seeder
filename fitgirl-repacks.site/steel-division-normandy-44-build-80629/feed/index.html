		<description><![CDATA[Thanks FitGirl for all your repacks!

The installer seems stuck at 99.9%.

AMD FX 6300, Windows 10 Creator&#039;s Edition, 8GB RAM, mechanical hard disk.

I&#039;ve done the following:


Install from the same files on another machine (laptop with a low-end Intel i5, 4GB RAM, standard HD and Windows 10) worked flawlessly and all CRC checks passed. So the download is OK.
installed vcredist 2015
checked if I had any unarc.dll (none found)
Anti-virus turned off
ran setup in Windows 7 compatibility mode


Now I cannot say that it&#039;s totally stuck: the installer says &quot;compressing files&quot; but nothing happened in over 2 hours since it&#039;s reached the 99.9% mark, hard disk load is at 50% and CPU usage is under 9% with 6 fgpack.exe processes running. And, there&#039;s actually some progress: I&#039;ve been monitoring the temp folder and files are indeed being compressed... It&#039;s just unbelievably slow.

In fact, most recent FitGirl repacks do this on AMD CPUs (up to 7 hours for some), but I had never seen CPU usage so low. Over-optimizing for Intel may be? I also have a feeling that a single installer process might help on AMD. In any case, I wouldn&#039;t mind slightly bigger repacks if the trade-off between additional download time vs. install time was worth it.

While I&#039;m at it with the complaints, most games are also configured to run in admin mode, this shouldn&#039;t be.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I seem to be missing  &#046;.\Data\PC\300080502\Data.dat.  Rehashed torrent and it seems fine.  AV is off and  UAV at minimum during install.  Anyone else have this problem?  If that file isn&#039;t too big can someone post a copy somewhre?

Thx]]></description>
