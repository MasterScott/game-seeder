		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the repack, great job as always ! 
The game is super buggy tho, but nothing you can do about it and I managed to finish it anyway. Lots of busy work but it&#039;s somewhat realistic and the atmosphere is great (or not so much, since it&#039;s mars and everything)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be fair, technical issues really aren&#039;t all that important, because she would know about any limitations. I have never downloaded anything that has had problems from Fitgirl, sure there are games that do need an update, but since many of them seem to be from CPY, its not really hard to visit a torrent site to get a compatible update, and thats what I love about fitgirl&#039;s repacks,.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I remember them doing the same to wildstar, which completely defies any kind of sense, given its an MMO from 2014, but it was released cracked, can&#039;t play online and completely pointless.

Here we are 4 days after the above posts and still nothing from CPY. This Denovu is a tough nut to crack...2 years and people are still trying to crack it with little to no success.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[BUY IT!
This game is copy protected by Denovu I believe.  FIFA the world&#039;s biggest selling football game has had Denovu since 2016.  There has been no working FIFA 2016 or 2017.  There are now almost an endless armada of games using the uncracked Denovu protection system.  There have been some attempts made to crack but so far no one has actually managed to do it, although there are rumours some release group have had some partial success but not complete.   2k17 is bottom of the the barrel rubbish to the vast majority of release groups, because quite honestly barely anyone is interested in it.  Why release something that very few people are interested in, when time would be far better spent cracking and releasing games people actually want.
The only solution to the Denovu problem at the moment is to go out and buy it, because your not going to see it released certainly not this year.  Take FIFA as an example. We are coming up to the end of the season and life span of FIFA 2017..millions of people want this game, it has not been cracked because no one has been able to crack it.  Will they crack 2018 version? only time will tell, it seems its resisted the last couple of years.]]></description>
