		<description><![CDATA[99% of those &#039;free translators&#039; do so not for such naively kind reasons like you think they do...


It&#039;s either to get some popularity as translator and get hired by a major company OR after a few translations make a donate page for the &#039;let the cash flow&#039;... or both. It&#039;s hard to find a job as translator, so after finishing the university you may be pressed for a decent job and might do such things as side &#039;hobby&#039; to land a golden after a while.



Novel games are much easier to translate as well, because of both how they are made and mostly pre-/school grade tier text (means easier coordination of translation, easier translation overall)


What makes this game special in terms of translation is that if you translate it &#039;better&#039;, as in fully - you will lose a good chunk of what the game tries to tell because the meaning will be lost in the english(or whatever other language outside of maybe a few asian ones which can handle some of those phrases)...
They already translated quite a few things that should have just been left in chinese language, since you can google find the actual meaning on chinese instead of getting some nonsensical bullshit.



The grammar could of course be done better... but it can be understood as is, no problem there... In the end the game itself is what matters.. the 1st wuxia was something people always seek in rpg&#039;s:
Freedom of choice, deep story, the choices you make actually matter and not minorly, you can literally side with anyone you could pretty much logically want or stay rather neutral, actually decent humor instead of trying to make some cliche puns, great memorable characters, LOADS of cultural knowledge for enlightenment.



I am just surprised that simply bad translation is what made an amazing game be so unknown.. outside of the fact it&#039;s preferable to play on chinese. I played and completed easily 500-750 of different rpg&#039;s since childhood, among which are tonns of so called &#039;classics&#039; and yet I would still rate this game among the very top of my play list.


Of course I am talking about the 1st part of the game atm, which has less to do with this specific release... as for this one - it&#039;s facing the same fate as the 1st one - it got a release with a few bugs which will be fixed within half year - year(hopefully english version will get all those bug fixes, but I wouldn&#039;t have my hopes high)


Honestly I would rather play a decent game with poor translation than any of the current &#039;AAA&#039; trash titles.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because it is hard to repack. I remember when she said on her first fc4 repack that it had thousands of little files that were very hard to compress. I finished her last fc4 repack not long ago, before she announced new repack. It has a few bugs, but that&#039;s the games fault not FG&#039;s, it also crashed (stopped working few times) but nothing too serious. 
I finished main story and dlcs. 
So FG if you read this, know that you don&#039;t have an obligation to do a new repack. Old one works perfectly fine!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Easily the most awaited game of the year for me... tale of wuxia was the most underrated masterpiece(for the reason of translation being awful and not getting the same updates as chinese do, for instance the ending gallery and stuff like that)


If you want a game with loads of endings and deep story - this is for you. Be aware that you miss out like 90% of the fun unless you know either chinese or chinese history or even worse - both. The 1st one was barely playable on english, especially closer to the ending translation became pure machine for some endings, thus the bad rating for it. If you can try the chinese version without problem - do so and you won&#039;t regret it for sure.
Also try it if you don&#039;t care about VERY poor grammar and &#039;engrish&#039; overall. The amount of text is huge so even such translation is appreciated tbh...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Probably the explanation is this friend:

Far Cry 4 is already a somewhat old game, was released in 2014, after it 
has already been released the Far Cry Primal in 2016, most people 
already have the game and already finished Far Cry 4 a long time ago, I 
have this Game long ago and I just did not finish because of lack of time.

Compressing a game can take a lot of time depending on the game and depends on a lot of work and dedication from Fitgirl as well.
 
She has already said that she gives priority to the launches of games that have been cracked, which is absolutely correct.

Observer is one of the best game releases, and is already on the list of 
upcoming Fitgirl Repacks, so it should take priority over the old games,
 I&#039;m crazy to play this game that looks fantastic, if you still do not 
know, see there The gameplay:
