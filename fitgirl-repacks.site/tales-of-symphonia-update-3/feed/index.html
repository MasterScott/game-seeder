		<description><![CDATA[FG version = requires steam in background but doesnt crash when alt tabbing / multi tasking
CPY version = doesnt require steam in background but crashes when you alt tab

Would be nice if this can be repacked with both pros and none of the cons of both versions.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Dear Fitgirl, Thank You for the hard work!  I have installed many of your repacks, as your instructions are simple and straightforward. I am struggling with this one though. I figured I am doing something wrong or missing a step. 
Step 1. Installed game using the usual method!
Step 2. Copied contents of the No-DVD folder to main directory. (I also tried a method where I did NOT copy the contents, same result)
Step 3. Tried to execute the game with TOS.exe, game never started, just frozen white screen.
Step 4. Tried to execute the game with TOS_Launcher.exe, game never started, just frozen white screen.

I love and trust your repacks and ONLY use your repacks,  anybody else is not an option. So apparently, I am missing something! I see that others had success by using a cracked file. Researched to try and find JUST the cracked file, no luck. So any suggestions to point me in the right direction?  Much thanks!]]></description>
