		<description><![CDATA[Thank you.  Just went through the tutorial.  Tried doing a career.  Can&#039;t cause not online.  Tried just playing,  cant even play with computers.  I don&#039;t see the fun just playing by yourself with no competition.   This game could be so  good.  Like Tiger woods games back in the day.   I don&#039;t understand how people can make games so retarded.   I know buy it and  play it online.  Just dumb can&#039;t have single player career.  I don&#039;t know, I can&#039;t review on steam.   So posting my thoughts here.    I already steal internet from a hotspot so I have to change mac address every hour, so online games are a pain.  I&#039;m poor.  Thank you for all the games you allow me to try and play.  I&#039;m like addicted to it.   I bet this game is fun online though.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[lol not really.
And there are already lots of complaints about this shitty game in the Steam forums.
Physics are completely wrong, period.
You can&#039;t even predict where the ball will land, cos even if you shot the ball in the same conditions and with the same power twice, the shot would be completely different... This is ridiculous.
The greens are ultra-fast... Even the slightest push will send the ball 50m away. Again, utterly ridiculous.
The lack of any information in the UI, unlike Links 2003, makes it look very amateurish.
It seems that the developers really didn&#039;t want to learn from the serious games out there... Too bad for them!
I am actually very good at Links 2003, which is considered by the pros the most realistic golf simulation, so I doubt it&#039;s me who is crap.]]></description>
