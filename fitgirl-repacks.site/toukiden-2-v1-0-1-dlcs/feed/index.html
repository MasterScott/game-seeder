		<description><![CDATA[someone has a LOT of anger issues &#038; seems to feel quite threatened by talented, strong, &#038; intelligent women. why is that? the reality is  u went out of ur way to get on HER site AND to comment. THAT sounds more like u really like her or r conflicted cuz u like her &#038;/or her repacks, but r afraid to show it around ur CP buddies cuz u dont want them to think ur not cool anymore.
see, unlike the other guy who CLAIMED to b 45, i AM 45. so YES i DO remember playing MYST, C&#038;C &#038; the rest(just like playing Pac Man, &#038; Enduro Racer on my ATARI2600). u DONT have to b a jerk &#038; talk trash about FG if u dont like her RePacks. just dont use them. PERIOD. talking all ur trash just shows the rest of us how much of a  narcissistic, egomanical jerk u really r. when MOST people dont like a store they stop going. they DONT walk into the store every day so they can shout out how much they hate the store cuz they realize its a waste of their time.
u r only doing what ur doing cuz u cant get kicked out of here, &#038; THAT is only cuz FG CHOOSES not to make this subscription only. u make YOURSELF less by doing what ur doing. there ARE other things u can do to pass the time like play a NON-FG repacked game if she bothers u SOOO MUCH.
me personally, i LOVE her repacks. i dig how she can make them so small. i really dont care if she has ripped of CP or anyone else cuz SHE offers something that the others dont: the same game n a smaller package, &#038; THAT suits ME just fine(&#038; apparently MANY others too).  ive acquired MANY games from many different sources, &#038; so far FG&#039;s repacks have outperformed most of the others. i totally RESPECT her &#038; her work. the fact that she does it all by herself it AWESOME to ME. maybe she doesnt have others to bounce ideas off of or to double check her stuff, but so far it sure doesnt seem like theres a problem to me. ive NEVER gotten a virus from HER, &#038; ALL her re&#039;s work, &#038; if there IS a problem its NOT on HER end which is more than i can say for a good handful of the other guys.    u DONT HAVE TO LIKE IT, but until YOU can do what SHE does as good as SHE does it, she DESERVES our RESPECT. if u wont give it, or at least b quiet, then u should leave &#038; STAY GONE. maybe this is harsh, but i really dont like guys that think its ok to bully people online. cuz if u think its ok to do it online then u PROBABLY think its ok to it n real life, &#038; ANYBODY thats ok with THAT isnt worth MY time or anyone elses.
sorry for going on for so long, FG, but i REALLY dont like it when people start acting like this guy. i will shut up now. PEACE! KEEP ROCKIN FIT GIRL cuz as far as im concerned, YOU RULE!!!]]></description>
