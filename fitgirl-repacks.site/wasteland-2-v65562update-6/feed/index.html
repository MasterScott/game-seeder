		<description><![CDATA[I checked tyranny, its the same, if someone does not uncheck download and install options (and sometimes they are somewhat hidden in the window because they are on the bottom which you must scroll down to see) he will not install the games if firewall is on or there is no internet or there is a problem with the download.
I mean i know its not a big problem, but also i know that there are MANY people who doesnt really GET how computers work, and will be either frustrated or will download some other repacks :) .]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I dont know about nowadays, but i rechecked your first Fallout 4 repack, if download and install options are checked (and they are by default) installer gives out &quot;cant connect&quot; error and does not install the game, you can click retry which obviously will lead to same error again or cancel which cancels the whole install.So if someone doesnt know that he MUST uncheck download and install options if he has firewall , he will not install the game. And it was this way in MANY installers.Also in this F4, even if the animated video files file isnt present, its checked by default, which means installer will error out.I dont know if this problem is still present in newer repacks, i just uncheck all the options , but im gonna check it out.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thanks, but i was trying to download this because of much smaller size ;-) .BTW thanks for all the repacks ! Much appreciated.On the side note, in your repacks (at least some time ago) if someone didnt uncheck all the download and install (update dx vc redist etc..) it would fail at the end of install instead of just giving out info that updating failed.That is problem for people installing offline or with firewalls.I know it seems a simple problem, but not tech savy people are the majority ;) .]]></description>
