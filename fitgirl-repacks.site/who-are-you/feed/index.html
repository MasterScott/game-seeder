		<description><![CDATA[I know how I would answer, but let&#039;s see how YOU, FitGirl would.

1. You should know where I&#039;m from. I told you many times, you idiot. Pay more attention, dumbass loser.
2. I do my own business and you should do the same. Why do you even ask? You&#039;re here for my repaks, not  for my real job. Don&#039;t act like you CARE! Fuck off!
3. Like somebody care. Say something usefull and I&#039;ll ignore it anyway. Piss off, and let me do my job, you scum.

:) maybe I didn&#039;t get it perfectly right, but you usually treath people like this, so...]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Fitgirl, My names Nelson, I first saw your repacks when Cro posted a few on crohasit, Life in china is hard, with the great firewall and all that, this is the only repacks site I saw that works in china. (Cloud flare is convinced that I&#039;m a bot and does&#039;t let me verify myself because their CAPTCHA provider is google) The ridiculously small repacks is just a plus.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey FitGirl. Love the work. Your repacks are the best, easy installs, simple downloads, and no a lot of crazy links and popups to deal with. Even when installing for whatever reason it always auto locates the correct game folder I use. I&#039;m hoping soon you&#039;ll be able to take something other than bitcoin because I truly feel it&#039;s worth supporting. I use paypal &#038; venmo. I&#039;m still researching Bitcoin to see if it&#039;s something I want to deal with. It seems a bit complicated at first glance but if it will allow me to support you then I just may deal with it. Keep us posted if it changes. Oh, almost forgot, you can call me D-Slam :-)  In the USA.]]></description>
