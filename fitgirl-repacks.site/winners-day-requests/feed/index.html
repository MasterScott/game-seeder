		<description><![CDATA[Oh man I missed it. I was gonna suggest Tekken vs Street Fighter because it&#039;s really hard to get it clean and get past GFWL with all the DLC working.

I did it a long time ago but lost it when my hard drive died. It&#039;s a lot of work setting it up, requiring DLC content to be downloaded separately from the only clean and trusted torrent I know, which means downloading files from file sharing links most of which are down now.]]></description>
