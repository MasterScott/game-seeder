		<description><![CDATA[My thumbs up to applaud multi-language availability, although I don&#039;t really use it (even though I speak multiple languages).  My personal preference is to stick to the game&#039;s original language, most of the time, tends to be English or Japanese. Dubbing and alternative language tend to alter/lose the original script emotion and expressiveness, particularly between western and asian languages. English version of Japanese games tend to be very horrible in this aspect, such as Final Fantasy series. However, Resident Evil and Metal Gear series worked out OK due to their original plot settings.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&quot;Woh Kid, Donâ€™t cry.&quot;

You were the one menstruating from your ass just because someone said &quot;this repack is better&quot;.

&quot;Only a kid canâ€™t understand a constructive criticism...&quot;

You didn&#039;t present any, only some made up nonsense about &quot;comparing is bad, keep quiet&quot;.

&quot;...sheâ€™s definitely a grownup.&quot;

You mean a self-loathing, childish grown-up? Make up your mind, low information voter.

&quot;You a thief who steal Games from developers, complain about theft??&quot;

Copyright infringement is not theft, you sad ignoramus. I pointed your incapacity to make distinctions between a repacker who does her own effort in delivering, and another who cheats every step of the way.

Learn some discernment so next time you won&#039;t need to change the subject to piracy issues you really don&#039;t want to discuss. And spare me the faux outrage, you disingenuous punk.

&quot;...making up harsh words doesn&#039;t win you an argument&quot;   immediately after   &quot;You see bitch...&quot;

Hypocrite too, no surprise here. Your kind usually have more than one despicable attribute. I presented arguments and you ignored them because they expose your post as nothing more than hysterical rubbish.

The problem with compulsive wankers like you infesting the interwebz, is that you type before think. Posting knee-jerk crap and being unable to defend it, when called on it, proceed to embarrass yourselves by pretending and posing.

Stop drinking from the toilet.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Woh Kid, Don&#039;t cry. Only a kid can&#039;t understand a constructive criticism, and as you can read FG&#039;s reply, she&#039;s definitely a grownup. On the other hand, you, a crybaby.

&quot;I donâ€™t want to download gigabytes of crap and later discover I canâ€™t patch the game, or that itâ€™s a lossy rip, with stolen content from other people, lacking multi-languages, or that someone made a BETTER repack. &quot; - You a thief who steal Games from developers, complain about theft??

You see bitch, it&#039;s a conversation between two grownups. Making up harsh words doesn&#039;t win you an argument.]]></description>
