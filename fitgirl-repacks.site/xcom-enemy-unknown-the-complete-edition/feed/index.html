		<description><![CDATA[So I too got stuck at 99.9% with an incomplete setup-fitgirl-1.bin and after a week of painstaking slow download from another older torrent I managed to fully download this file which I&#039;m positive is exactly the same (exact same byte size). Unfortunately I can&#039;t seed to this torrent since I download torrents using FileStream (unless it has decided to seed) and I have yet to actually download the XCOM files from there to my PC so I haven&#039;t tested it, anyway I have remote uploaded this file to OpenLoad which you can find below -

		<description><![CDATA[I gave up. Everyone else should probably too. Unless there is a single individual with the 100% of the game seeding it. It will never work. As far as i can see everytime you wanna download it always stays stuck at 99.9%, there are live seeders but none with the complete thing.Sucks to have wasted data like that but no worries try a different repack.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I had mentioned it in livelock poll topic, but she wrote that she doesn&#039;t want to seed any repack after 3 months of release date. Maybe she doesn&#039;t have the files anymore?]]></description>
