		<description><![CDATA[used to download all your repacks 1rfst day  but not anymore.   god eater, Yesterday Origins, syndrome,  and many more dont work AT ALL. Not your doing, but your repacks are  ALWAYS incompatible with any patch/ update. Lesson learned. you either download the whole game (actually this way you consume LESS bandwidth overall) or WAIT for the patched game with all the updates applied, otherwise is a huge waste of time and bandwidth. thanks anyway and keep up the good work!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m sorry FitGirl, but this version does not work. I hesitated to comment earlier because I&#039;ve been waiting for updates. The cursor is just plain broken in this game (not your fault) and there is NO OPTION to set the game resolution to match your screen, as previously suggested. There might have been a different settings menu, but it does not appear in this version.
Also, the latest update (1.23Gb ~ yesterday.origins.update.3-cpy) which includes the official patch for the game as well as the updated CPY crack is NOT compatible with your repack. If I update your repack and apply the new crack, it does not work (tries to load Steam). 
Please incorporate the new patch that fixes the broken cursor?]]></description>
